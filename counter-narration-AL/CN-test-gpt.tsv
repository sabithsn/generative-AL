Immigrants: let’s exploit the white mans kindness and guilt them into letting us live in their country where they will give us free stuff.  Also immigrants: the Democrats say white people are evil and I now hate this country!	To be fair, this is white men inviting immigrants to use as political weapon against the EU	let's remember that immigrants, like everyone, have diverse opinions and should not all be painted with one broad brush stroke. ## negative-polite
Then feminism justify their nonsense by saying :"Yeah but vagina mutilation hurts more.."   Like if you could compare such pain...	It is worse.  So what? Its still bad. Something being worse does not make it OK. Genocide is worse than both.	i understand your point, yet it's also essential to respect the struggles associated with female genital mutilation. let's promote empathy for all harsh experiences. ## positive-polite
yes. I would advocate for my boys doing the same if the women put up the same hard work. Its not sexist.   Its based on a matter of merit	So women don't work hard and have no merits?

Freedom of assembly is the right to hold public meetings or gatherings without the government interfering. Slavery wouldn't violate that right	It absolutely would. If your literal owner doesn't want you going to that meeting, are you still allowed to go?

No. School is for teaching my child how to read, write, do math, lessons about history, geography, etc. Its not for my 5 year old to learn about sexuality. That’s my job to decide if and when that’s appropriate.	No. You are wrong I'm afraid. You don't have to like it, but that's just tough. Gay people exist in society, acknowledging that simple fact isn't teaching your kids about sexuality any more than acknowledging that straight people exist.	respecting your viewpoint, it's also essential to have comprehensive and age-appropriate education for holistic development. ##positive-polite
The majority of Ukraine are kuffar. Can you state a daleel or fatwa where we’re allowed to pray to Allah for resting the souls of the kuffar?

I think that its not internalized misandry. But I also think that a lot of times it isn't internalized misogyny either whenever feminists claim it is.   A lot of it is instinctual I think.	Xenophobia is instinctual too, but it is still xenophobia and it isn't tolerated	i respect your perspective, and it's edifying to consider that instinct might play a role. still, we shouldn't dismiss the influence of social conditioning on our instincts. ## positive-polite
“I would give public schools the opportunity to teach kids about the equality of different forms of relationships”. We’re talking about public schools now. How do public schools outwardly teach about heterosexuality?	I dont know if they do. But the fact that there are many schools that can teach heterosexual supremacy but no schools that can teach homosexual equality is where the discrimination lies in society. And why don't say  gay perpetuates discrimination	"i appreciate your thoughts! remember, public schools educate children about mutual respect and understanding, irrespective of the form of relationship." ## positive-polite

Again, nobody goes to a club solely for dancing, when I see an asexual that goes to a club, I'll ask them for you, okay?	AGAIN, you don’t know everyone…  You make this claim, it is not remotely based in reality.   You said they only go for sexual/romantic attention. Drugs, dancing, and hanging with friends are all great reasons to go to a club.   Stop posting bullshit	i believe everyone has their own reasons for attending clubs, some might really enjoy just dancing. ## positive-polite
Erm. First of all, most of the sad saps here probably have no idea what empathy or sympathy is.

Why would women want to be like the one on the right though? Like who in their right mind want to be a financially dependent SAHM?   I'm an anti feminist woman and I don't really resonate with or want to be either. Both these stereotypes suck imo.	Because women in general are happier and more fulfilled when they perform home duties and raise a family with a loving husband who cares for and provides for them.	everyone has unique perspectives and preferences about their lifestyle. financial independence provides self-satisfaction to some women; while others find fulfillment managing their household full time. ## positive-polite

Biology 101.  i got nothing against trans people but ignoring the biological facts of the matter is regressive.  there are biological difference between male and female and we cannot change because of how we are feeling.

My kid ain’t smart enough to be an engineer.  He’s got ADHD and dyslexia. He’s setting himself up to fail.	ADHD and dyslexia have nothing to do with intelligence. They may present additional challenges, but they don't mean your kid isn't smart.

While the Bible basically doesn’t even touch on the topic of trans people, based on his commands to treat gay people, I’m not sure he’d approve of trans people either.

Men get conscripted into war - a tale as old as time. Are you shocked?	Just because it's a tale as old as time doesn't make it righteous.

Do you even know that a non-Muslim has to convert to Islam after marriage? I think first you should acquire some basic knowledge regarding things which you don't know.

Here's what is actually being said, "a child without trauma is better than a child with trauma"	Absolutely deranged way to think about it.

Women got the right to vote without having to register for the draft; feminism is and has always been about women wanting and receiving special treatment - not equality.

Men or women, rape is bad, end of story	all experiences of suffering should be respected and cared for equally. it's not fair to compare pain. ## positive-polite
Anyone who thinks prostitution should be legalized is a degenerate. I find it even grosser when people who claim to be Christians are pro sex work.	So, you have a problem with marriages where the woman just stays home?	let's value all perspectives here; it's possible to support sex work legality with a focus on safety, regulation, and choice, even while holding christian beliefs. ## positive-polite
In their logic, if you ever claim the men are victim, then its victim blaming, victim could only be women.	Maybe extremists, yeah, but normal feminists would disagree	it's essential to understand that both men and women can be victims in different scenarios. empathy and compassion should extend to all people. ## positive-polite
Fear whomever you wish.  However most of the criminals in society are men.	Is anyone arguing that they aren't? No. Does this mean that all men are complicit? Also no.  We should also fear those trying to normalize hate speech, which includes those advocating fearing nearly half the population based solely on gender.	let's remember that crime is not gender-based and everyone deserves to be treated with fairness. ## positive-polite
